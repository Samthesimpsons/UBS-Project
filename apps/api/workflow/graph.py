"""LangGraph workflow definition for the customer service chatbot.

Implements a plan-and-execute pattern where:
1. The planner analyzes the user query and creates an execution plan
2. The executor dispatches steps to specialist agents
3. A synthesizer combines all results into a final response

All LLM calls use Gemini with structured outputs via Pydantic models.
